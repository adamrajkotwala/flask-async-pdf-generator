# flask-async-pdf-generator
There are two versions included, one that uses celery and redis (celery.py), and one that uses threading (threads.py). To use celery.py, I was running Ubuntu 24.04 through WSL. The version of Python I used was 3.8.3. The threads version cannot check the status of a task, because they don't exist, emphasizing the benefit of using celery. With both you must create a python virtual environment and install the dependencies from requirements.txt. Once created, you must activate it in every terminal window you use. I say this because for the celery-redis version, you need three separate windows open. One to activate the celery worker (celery -A celery.celery worker --loglevel=info), one to run the flask application, and one to check the status of your redis server (sudo service redis-server status), which you can also use to make further commands. Regarding the web application, async uses either celery or threads, and the synchronous version works as standard. I implemented this to show comaprison between the two. Static hosts the created pdfs. Simply delete them after running each time. Each pdf is generated with a random amount of WWII history information added onto it to simulate different sized pdfs.
